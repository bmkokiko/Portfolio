📦 Integrated Manufacturing Data Simulation
ERP | MES | SCADA/PLC | SQL Server | Python

This project simulates a fully integrated chemical manufacturing environment using three interrelated SQL Server databases:

ERP Database – Represents enterprise functions like inventory, production orders, and material planning.

MES Database – Tracks production execution, operator logs, work centers, and material usage across shop floor operations.

Control System Database – Emulates PLC/SCADA signals, sensor data, and real-time equipment status tied to MES and ERP processes.

The databases are structured to reflect ISA-95 hierarchical levels, enabling traceable data flow from raw material input to finished goods output.

📊 Use Cases:

Simulating production runs with timestamped sensor data

Linking control signals to batch records and ERP work orders

Enabling future development for Python-based analytics, data validation, or real-time dashboards

🛠️ Ideal for demonstrating:

Industrial data modeling

Manufacturing IT integrations

SQL analytics in a manufacturing context

MES/ERP interface design
